# calculator

The code defines four functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide, which perform the respective arithmetic operations on two integers.
The calculate function takes a function reference as an argument along with two integers, and it calls the provided function with the given integers as parameters.
In the main function, the user is prompted to enter two integers.
The read_line method of the stdin object is used to read the user input and store it in a mutable String variable.
The trim method is used to remove any whitespace characters from the input.
The parse method is used to convert the input to an integer.
The calculate function is called with different arithmetic operations and the values of a and b.
The results of the calculations are then printed to the console.
